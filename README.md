# UEA Web Team's UI Library

## Installation

Run `npm i @ueaweb/ui`

Import the component you need with `import { Button } from '@ueaweb/ui';`

Have at it!

## Development

### Scripts

- `npm ci` Install from package-lock.json
- `npm start` Start developing with Storybook
- `npm run component [new-component-name]` Create boilerplate for a new component. This adds a new .tsx file to `./src/components/` and appends its import/export to `./src/components/index.ts`.
- `npm run build` Compiles your development work into browser-ready code in the dist folder. This folder is what gets published to npm.
